    "## Materialization 101\n",
    "\n",
    "An RDFS graph is a semantic multigraph, a collection of nodes with edges and labels, out of which there could be multiple outgoing edges from a single node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"semantic\" part means that its nodes have _semantics_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand the semantics of RDFS, we ought to first have a look at how the data really looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data-format wise, it is usually stored with the file extension `.nt`. It is a very simple format: one triple per line.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts of an RDFS graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is the _TBOX_, the ontology, the set of nodes that encodes the hierarchy of the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(employee, rdf:type, Class)\n",
    "(faculty, rdfs:subClassOf, employee)\n",
    "(professor, rdfs:subClassOf, faculty)\n",
    "(teaches, rdf:type, rdf:Property)\n",
    "(lectures, rdfs:subPropertyOf, teaches)\n",
    "(teaches, rdfs:domain, professor)\n",
    "(course, rdf:type, Class)\n",
    "(teaches, rdfs:range, course)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this graph, we define that *employee* is a _Class_, *faculty* is a _type_ of *employee*, *professor* is a _subClass_ of *faculty*, *teaches* is a _type_ of _property_, *lectures* is a _subProperty_ of *teaches*, and that *teaches* is in the _domain_ of *professor*, alongside with *course*, a _Class_, is in the _range_ of *teaches*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up there is the _ABOX_, which is where assertions about individuals based on the rules we've defined on the _TBOX_ are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(professor1, lectures, course1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From this assertion, much implicit knowledge could be derived. For instance, `lecture` is a subclass of `teaches`, hence we can say that the professor teaches. `teaches` is in the domain of `professor`, so `professor1` must be a professor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Materialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFS has a set of _entailment_ rules which dictate its _semantics_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are they(the ones that matter, for now):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ":A(?y, rdf:type, ?x) :- :T(?a, rdfs:domain, ?x), :A(?y, ?a, ?z) . // 1\n",
    ":A(?z, rdf:type, ?x) :- :T(?a, rdfs:range, ?x), :A(?y, ?a, ?z) . // 2\n",
    ":T(?x, rdfs:subPropertyOf, ?z) :- :T(?x, rdfs:subPropertyOf, ?y), :T(?y, rdfs:subPropertyOf, ?z) . // 3\n",
    ":T(?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?z) :- :T(?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?y), :T(?y, rdfs:subClassOf, ?z) . // 4\n",
    ":A(?x, ?b, ?y) :- :T(?a, rdfs:subPropertyOf, ?b), :A(?x, ?a, ?y) . // 5\n",
    ":A(?z, rdf:type, ?y) :- :T(?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?y), :A(?z, rdf:type, ?x) . // 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to read a rule is quite straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, `:T(?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?z) :- :T(?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?y), :T(?y, rdfs:subClassOf, ?z) .` is spelled as: If the tbox triples (?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?y)\n",
    "and (?y, rdfs:subClassOf, ?z) exist in the tbox, then (?x, subClassOf, ?z) *must* exist in the tbox as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To _materialize_ an RDFS graph, means adding all triples which *must* exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, materializing the given _TBOX_ yields the following triples to be added:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(faculty, rdfs:type, Class)\n",
    "(professor, rdf:type, Class)\n",
    "(professor, rdfs:subClassOf, employee)\n",
    "(lectures, rdf:type, rdf:Property)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And now for the _ABOX_, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(professor1, rdf:type, professor)\n",
    "(course1, rdf:type, course)\n",
    "(professor1, teaches, course1)\n",
    "(professor1, rdf:type, faculty)\n",
    "(professor1, rdf:type, employee)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As it can be seen, there are is no more *knowledge* that can be inferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiments | Thesis\n",
    "In this article https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3337/semrec_paper4.pdf the authors propose a way to __learn__ how to materialize RDFS graphs in a way that could be transferred to other unseen RDFS graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not as hard of a task as it seems, because RDFS materialization has a __fixed__ set of semantic nodes (the ones with prefix rdf: and rdfs:). This is different from attempting to infer\n",
    "from natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The code of that article lives here: https://github.com/Monireh2/kg-deductive-reasoner/tree/master\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert what is in `memn2n` to use `tensorflow` in a way that it could be just dropped in here: https://github.com/Monireh2/kg-deductive-reasoner/blob/master/train_test_kg_reasoner.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the tests, verify that your solution has the same result as the from-scratch one."
